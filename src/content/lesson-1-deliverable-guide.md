# Week 1 Deliverable Guide
## What You Need to Do
Write a one-page analysis of an architectural decision from a real system you've worked on or observed.
One page = ~500-800 words. Quality over quantity!

## Requirements (The Must-Haves)
1. 2-3 architectural decisions identified and analyzed
2. Context and constraints explained
    - Who was involved?
    - What was the project?
    - What constraints existed? (budget, time, team, etc.)

## What went right

Benefits achieved
Problems solved
Wins (even failures have some wins!)

## What went wrong

Issues encountered
Pain points
Unexpected consequences

## Tradeoff analysis

What was sacrificed to gain what?
Why were these tradeoffs made?
Were they worth it?

## Your thoughts

Your analysis and perspective
Not just "the team did X"
What would you do differently? Why?


## Nice to Have (Bonus Points!)

- Alternative approaches you considered
- Lessons learned
- Connection to class concepts (Conway's Law, quality attributes, golden hammer)
- Honesty and self-reflection (we learn from failures!)
