# Why Ada?
### Context for the Modern Developer

Ada was designed for environments where a software bug isn't just a "crash"—it's a mission failure.

- **Strongly Typed**: No implicit conversions (even stricter than Rust).
- **Built-in Concurrency**: The "Tasking" model is part of the language, not a library.
- **Readability**: Designed to be read more often than written (COBOL/Pascal-like syntax).
- **SPARK**: A subset of Ada that allows for formal mathematical verification.
